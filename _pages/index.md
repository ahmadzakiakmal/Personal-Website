<h1>About Me</h1>

  Hello! I'm a final-year **Information Engineering** student at **Universitas Gadjah Mada**, with a strong focus on **Software Engineering**, particularly in **web development**.

  Recently, I've been exploring exciting new fields like **Blockchain Technology** and **Distributed Systems** for my thesis, and I’m keen to deepen my expertise in these areas.

  I’m available for freelance software development projects. If you're interested in collaborating, feel free to reach out via email [here](mailto:ahmadzaki2975@gmail.com).
