During my **internship** at **Packet Systems Indonesia (PSI)**, I was assigned to develop a **mobile application** aimed at helping companies analyze **employee performance** and provide **customer service** using an integrated **chatbot** solution.

Together with my friend, [**Aufa Rahman**](https://aufarhmn.my.id), we designed the **UI** of the app and developed it to serve as the **front end** for the system. The mobile app was connected to the **API** developed by the **Software Solution Services (SSS) Team** at PSI. The app was built using **React Native**, ensuring cross-platform functionality and a smooth user experience.

On our final day, we presented the completed project to the **SSS Team**, including the **Vice President** of PSI. The team greatly appreciated the result, highlighting the app's potential for improving both internal processes and customer interactions.
