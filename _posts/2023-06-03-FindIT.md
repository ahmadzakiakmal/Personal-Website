I was honored to lead the **front-end team** responsible for developing the official website for **FindIT! UGM**. In this project, I focused on the **front-end development**, primarily handling **layouts**, **animations**, and **logic implementation**. I also collaborated with the back-end team to ensure seamless **integration** between the front-end and back-end systems. Additionally, I contributed to the **websocket technology** required for the Informatics Competition platform.
