I had the privilege of being part of the **outsourced development team** tasked with creating the eventâ€™s official website, alongside two of my close collaborators. Together with [**Aufa Rahman**](https://aufarhmn.my.id), who handled the **back-end development**, and [**Afix Vega**](https://github.com/afixv), our talented **UI/UX designer**, we worked to ensure that the website not only met the functional requirements but also delivered an engaging user experience.

Our goal was to design a platform that could efficiently showcase the event's details, schedule, speakers, and registration process, providing seamless access to information for attendees and stakeholders. We focused on building a modern, responsive website using a stack of powerful technologies, including **Next.js** for the front-end framework, **TailwindCSS** for efficient styling, **Express.js** to handle server-side functionality, and **MongoDB** as the database for managing the data securely.

The collaboration among our team was key to ensuring the success of the project. Aufa managed the integration of the back-end logic with the database, ensuring smooth data flow and secure communication between the website and its server. Afix, meanwhile, carefully crafted the user interface to make the website intuitive and visually appealing, focusing on delivering an effortless experience for visitors, regardless of the device they used.

The final product was a fully functional, user-friendly website that successfully served its purpose as the online face of **Industrial Workshop UGM 2023**. It was designed to enhance event visibility, improve user engagement, and facilitate a smooth experience for everyone involved. The website not only met the expectations of the client but also received positive feedback from users for its usability and design.
