**Histara** is an innovative application designed to enhance the experience of touring **historical sites** across **Indonesia**. The app provides both **audio and visual map guidance**, offering users an immersive experience as they explore various historical landmarks. Histara not only focuses on delivering informative tours, but also allows users to **book tours**, read **articles** on accommodations and local cuisine, and even **trade points** earned from completing tours for rewards.

The project was a collaborative effort with my colleague, [**Aufa Rahman**](https://aufarhmn.my.id). I was primarily responsible for the development of the **main application** and the integration of the **Map service**, which was built using **Next.js** and **Leaflet**. The map service enables users to navigate through historical sites with detailed visual aids, making their exploration more interactive and user-friendly. On the other hand, **Aufa** took charge of the **back-end development**, which included setting up the server-side logic with **Express.js**, managing data with **MongoDB**, and integrating **MidTrans** as the payment gateway for booking tours and transactions.

Together, we ensured that **Histara** was not only feature-rich but also technically robust. The use of **TypeScript** and **React Native** for the app development enabled us to deliver a seamless cross-platform experience, making the app accessible to a wide range of users. The integration of the **payment system** ensured that users could securely book and pay for their tours within the app, creating a smooth and efficient user journey from start to finish.

The development of Histara was an exciting opportunity to combine our passion for technology with the rich cultural heritage of Indonesia. The app aims to provide both locals and tourists with a deeper connection to the country's history, while also promoting tourism and local businesses along the way.
