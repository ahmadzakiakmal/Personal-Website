During my time as a **front-end developer** on the **ENOVA Project**, I played a significant role in developing a **smart IoT-based system** aimed at addressing the waste management issues in Yogyakarta. This project, initiated by **PT. Solusi Cerdas Sampah Indonesia**, sought to create an innovative solution to tackle the trash problem in the region. ENOVA Project was responsible for implementing the necessary technologies, including designing and developing the **monitoring hardware**, a **mobile application**, and a **website** that worked in unison to manage and monitor waste disposal more effectively.

In this project, I focused primarily on the **front-end development**, where I utilized technologies like **Next.js**, **TailwindCSS**, and the **Recharts library** for creating interactive data visualizations. My contributions helped ensure that the user interface was both functional and visually appealing, enhancing the overall user experience for the website and mobile application.
