**Technocorner UGM** is an event organized by the **Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Engineering (DTETI)** at Universitas Gadjah Mada. The event focuses primarily on electronics and robotics, along with competitions related to internet of things (IoT).

I worked extensively on the **front-end** development of the main Technocorner website, contributing to key areas such as **visual design**, **layout**, and user **interactions**. On the **back-end**, I handled the **CRUD endpoints** required for various functionalities.

Additionally, I led a sub-team responsible for developing the **Electrical Engineering Competition's exam platform**. My responsibilities included both front-end and back-end tasks. On the front-end, I focused on **layout design**, **visual logic implementation**, and enhancing **user interactions**. For the back-end, I developed the **CRUD endpoints** and managed **websocket communications** to ensure real-time functionality.

The technologies I used throughout the project included **Next.js**, **TailwindCSS**, **Socket.IO**, **ExpressJS**, and **MongoDB**.
