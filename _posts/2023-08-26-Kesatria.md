**PPSMB Kesatria** (now known as **Pionir Kesatria**) is the orientation program for new students at the **Faculty of Engineering, Universitas Gadjah Mada**. This program serves as an essential introduction for freshmen, helping them acclimate to university life, academic culture, and the values of the faculty. Over the years, the event has evolved to incorporate both online and offline activities, ensuring that students receive crucial information and guidance in a well-rounded manner.

I was assigned the role of **sub-coordinator** for the **Public Relations & IT Division**, leading the IT sub-division. My responsibilities included overseeing the development and maintenance of the website designed to deliver materials and content to the freshmen. I coordinated the team to ensure smooth website functionality, covering everything from initial development to ongoing updates. Additionally, I played a key role in **streaming the event**, ensuring seamless virtual participation for students.
