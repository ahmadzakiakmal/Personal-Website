As part of my **Student Community Service (KKN)** program conducted in **Bayan**, North Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara, I developed a **website** to help promote the region and its unique potential. The KKN-PPM project, carried out in **Desa Bayan** and **Desa Senaru**, has led to several key achievements that have positively impacted the local community.

One of the major successes was the creation of a **web application** for **Kecamatan Bayan**, which has significantly enhanced the visibility of both Desa Bayan and Desa Senaru. The website serves as an effective promotional platform, showcasing the **tourism potential**, **cultural richness**, and **local activities** of the two villages to a broader audience. By increasing awareness, the website aims to attract more tourists and support the local economy.
