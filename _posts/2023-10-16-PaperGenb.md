Paper GenB is an innovative, eco-friendly detergent made using **Belimbing Wuluh** (*Averrhoa bilimbi*), aimed at offering a sustainable alternative to synthetic detergents. As part of this initiative, I was contracted to develop the **official Paper GenB website** to promote the product and allow customers to place orders directly online. The website also serves as an educational platform, informing users about the environmental benefits of the product and how it helps reduce plastic waste and water pollution.

For this project, I was responsible for developing the **front-end** of the website using **Next.js** and **TailwindCSS**, ensuring a modern and responsive user interface. The main focus was to create a seamless shopping experience for users, allowing them to easily browse through the product information and make purchases. The website design emphasizes simplicity and user-friendliness while maintaining a clean, professional aesthetic that aligns with the brandâ€™s eco-friendly message. I also worked to integrate educational elements into the website, which help users understand the importance of choosing sustainable products like Paper GenB.

Throughout the development process, I ensured that the website was fully optimized for different devices and screen sizes, ensuring accessibility and a smooth user experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop platforms. By using **Next.js**, I was able to improve performance and ensure that the website loads efficiently. The **TailwindCSS** framework allowed me to rapidly style the components while keeping the codebase clean and manageable.
