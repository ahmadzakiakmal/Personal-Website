During my time as a **research assistant**, I had the opportunity to collaborate on a groundbreaking project known as **E-RISPK (E-Rencana Induk Sistem Proteksi Kebakaran dan Penyelamatan) DamKar**. This project was part of a larger collaboration between **Universitas Gadjah Mada's Civil Engineering and Information Engineering Team** and the **Fire Fighters of Yogyakarta**. The initiative, led by [**Dr. Guntur Dharma Putra**](https://gdputra.github.io), aimed to develop an advanced **information system** to support the firefighting teams in Yogyakarta by providing crucial real-time data and tools to improve their operational efficiency and response times.

The primary goal of this collaboration was to create a system that could deliver comprehensive and actionable information, such as **maps** highlighting areas with **active hydrants**, **firefighter response times**, locations of **gas stations**, **firefighter posts**, and other potential **danger zones**. This system also offers vital documents and statistics, displayed through **charts and graphs**, which provide an overview of the Fire Fighter team's performance and readiness. The integration of these features is designed to help the team make faster, more informed decisions during emergencies.

In this project, I was responsible for the **UI design**, ensuring that the interface was intuitive and user-friendly for the firefighting teams. I led the development of the **front end** using **Next.js** and **TailwindCSS**, focusing on creating a responsive and seamless experience across devices. Additionally, I took on the task of building the **back-end infrastructure** with **MongoDB** and **Express.js**, ensuring that the system could securely store and manage the vast amounts of data needed for the project.

Working on **E-RISPK DamKar** was both a challenging and rewarding experience, as it required the integration of various technologies to solve real-world problems. By bridging the gap between **technology** and **emergency services**, this system plays a key role in enhancing the firefighting efforts in Yogyakarta, improving both the efficiency of the teams and the safety of the local community.
